## Improvements:
> Since this application is to practice `PWA`'s and storing data with indexedDB, there really wasn't much to it however, I thought that this would be a good chance to try out some of the `Javascript frameworks` such as [Tilt.js](https://micku7zu.github.io/vanilla-tilt.js/) & [AOS.js](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos).
